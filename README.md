# Generate_Noisy_DataSet

This repository contains an R script that adds two types of noiseâ€”Gaussian noise and spike noiseâ€”to hyperpolarized gas (HPG) MRI images. The script simulates realistic imaging artifacts, helping researchers study the impact of noise in MRI processing and deep learning models.


## Introduction
MRI images often contain two types of noise that affect their quality and accuracy:

-  Random Gaussian Noise: Caused by thermal fluctuations and electronic system noise.
- Spike Noise: High-intensity values in k-space, often due to hardware instability or interference.
This script simulates these noise types in Fourier-transformed images and generates a noisy dataset that can be used for testing noise reduction algorithms, deep learning models, or statistical analysis.

## Noise Types
- Gaussian Noise:	Random fluctuations in pixel intensity	Added to real and imaginary components of k-space
- Spike Noise:	Isolated high-intensity points in k-space	Injected at random locations with varying magnitudes

## Installation & Dependencies
Prerequisites
Make sure you have R installed on your system. You can download it from:
ðŸ”— https://cran.r-project.org/

## Required R Packages
Ensure you have the following R packages installed before running the script:

```bash
install.packages("stats")
```

## Usage
## Step 1: Set Up Directories
Modify the script to specify:
source_dir â†’ Directory containing original HPG MRI images in .Rdata format.
output_dir â†’ Directory where noisy datasets will be saved.
## Step 2: Run the Script

## Step 3: Output Files
After execution, the script generates and saves noisy images with:

- Original MRI image
- Fourier Transformed (FT) image
- Noisy Fourier Transformed image
- Inverse Fourier Transformed noisy image (back to image space)

## How It Works
1. Loads Original MRI Data
    Reads .Rdata files containing HPG MRI images.
2. Performs Fourier Transform (FT)
    Converts images to k-space representation using FFT.
3. Adds Noise to k-space
    Randomly selects Gaussian noise or spike noise.
    Gaussian noise: Generated from a normal distribution and added to k-space.
    Spike noise: Random high-intensity spikes are inserted at different locations.
4. Performs Inverse FT
    Converts noisy k-space data back to image space using inverse FFT.
5. Saves Processed Data
     Noisy and original images are saved for further analysis.
